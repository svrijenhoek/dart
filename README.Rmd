# Jensen-Shannon divergence for all recommender strategies without cutoff

```{r, fig.cap="Jensen-Shannon divergence for each DART metric for all neural recommender strategies, with and without rank-awareness, and without a cutoff. Without rank-awareness and cutoff no divergence is found for the Activation, Representation and Alternative Voices metrics, as in these cases the recommendation and the context are identical.
